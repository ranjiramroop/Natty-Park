# National Parks Finder

We at Team TitanicFloatNone are a diverse group of individuals with one thing in common -- we have a burning passion for the outdoors. We find solace in nature, and we value it above most other things. This is why we have decided to create a simple and useful tool for like-minded people. National Parks Finder is a one-stop resource that allows the user to explore the national parks in their area, save specific parks to a visit wishlist, and leave reviews of these parks for other users to read. 

## Motivation

National Parks Finder provides a simple, intuitive resource to assist outdoor enthusiasts in planning their next adventure!

## How to use National Parks Finder

National Parks Finder utilizes a simple UI that allows users to search for national parks using a standard two-digit state code. The user can then navigate the search results park-by-park, and has the option to add specific parks to their own personal wishlist. In addition, the user may leave reviews of parks that they've visited in order to help future users. This information and more is visibly by simply clicking on any park that is returned in the search results.
